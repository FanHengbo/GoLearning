# GoLearning
I've been reading **The Go Programming Language** these days. It's really a nice book for a novice to begin with. I will put my own solutions of selected exercises(only those seem challenging for me) in this repo, and also I'd like to write a few notes about syntax feature, implementation details and source code analysis of GO. After all, understanding what happens under the hood is the key to lean a new programming language.
